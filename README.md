Problem statement

A common business requirement in the context of information gathering is to extract and filter relevant data from web pages that host this information. 
However, access to information spread over several web pages, hosted potentially on multiple websites is a cumbersome process and we cannot rely on 
manual procedures to execute this task. In this project, you will employ a programmatic approach to access, parse and extract relevant information from a website of interest.

Objective

The project's goal is to extract data (from a chosen number of pages) from The Movie Database website (https://www.themoviedb.org/) into a tabular data format so that further analysis 
(e.g., details about a movie's genre, cast, and user rating) can be facilitated.

Pre-requisites :

Tools: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab or Microsoft Visual Studio IDE

Languages: Python, HTML

Libraries: requests, beautifulSoup, pandas
